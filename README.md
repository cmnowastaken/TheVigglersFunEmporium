### The Viggler's Fun Emporium

This project is to be assessed on the criteria of NCEA assessments AS91906 and AS91907.

The purpose of the project is to provide a dashboard for a theme park, with a simulator 
built in as (shockingly) I don't have time to make a theme park to draw data from.

In order to run, download the project and run it in BlueJ, as this was the IDE used for
the development, as well as the IDE that it will be assessed in.
